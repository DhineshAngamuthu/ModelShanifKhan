  <h3 class="w3-center">ABOUT ME</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em>I love modelling</em></p>
  <p><h3>Shanif Khan</h3> (born 26th of August, 1995) is a self made model and founder of ACARA Modelling Management.  <br>
    Started off as a young boy with big dreams, now stands as a determined young man with goals.  <br> <br>

  <h1> CAREER AND PERSONAL LIFE:</h1> <br> <br>
    
    Shanif Khan graduated college in the year 2016. He got recruited in an IT company but that didn’t last long.  <br>
    Not longer than two whole days. A little voice inside his head reminded him that his purpose was larger than a desk job.  <br>
    And so he quit. A year of hardships passed by with no hope for his modelling future.  <br>
    Once he felt that all hope was lost, he received a life changing offer in the year 2017 from a clothing brand called “Grad by Workaholic”.  <br>
    This modelling opportunity changed his life and showed him that he was on the right path.  <br>
    With all this success came a load of misery as well when Shan spiralled into depression and got lost in a dark abyss.  <br>
    His only friend was the color black that reflected the shade of his heart and mind.  <br>
    His guardian angel, his mother guided him into the light and showed him that life was worth living.   <br>
    This period is what Shan considers to be his lowest point in life.  <br>
    With his mother as his biggest supporter, he began where he left off.  <br>
    A fiery passion for working out erupted in Shan and he began training day and night.  <br>
    He found the perfect analogy to turning all the negativity in his life to positive thoughts.  <br>
    This made him believe that everything happens for a reason and whatever happens, life must go on.  <br><br>
    
    With a desire and deep drive he entered back into the modelling business, Shan took up a part time job at a friend’s clothing store, Tequila. <br>
    During this time (2018) is when Shan revived another job opportunity for a company called “Wulf”.  <br>
    Tackling between a day job and show business was a task for Shan. <br>
    Days consisted of running back and forth the store to shoots. <br>
    Shan has received warnings from the store manager during several occasions. <br>
    The manager had a change of heart when he was invited as a sponsor for the pageant “Mr and Miss Coimbatore 2019”. <br>
    Seeing Shanif treated as royalty and looked at as a star changed everything. <br>
    Shan’s noticeable humility and adaptable nature is what made him the man he is today. <br><br>
    
    Mid 2019, national brand named “Demin Hut” approach Shan looking for a new face as they are planning a nation wide launch of their company. <br>
    This is major breakthrough for Shan when he decides to chop off his luscious locks and transform into the best version of himself. <br>
    This modelling contract changed his life and gave him new insights. <br><br>
    
    Now, Shan poses as the brand ambassador for a domestic brand “Scoot Clothing” and tee shirt company “F Bros”.<br><br>
    
    <h1>ACHIEVEMENTS:</h1><br><br>
    
    Shan has rocked the pageant world in and around Coimbatore, creating a name for himself. His well known achievements are :<br><br>
    
      1.	Mr King of Coimbatore (2018)<br>
      2.	Mr Style Icon of Erode (2018)<br>
      3.	Mr Fresh Face of Chennai (2018)<br>
      4.	Best Model of Coimbatore (2019)<br><br>
    
      <h1>FUTURE GOALS:</h1><br><br>
    
    Shan has achieved a lot until now and is not stopping ever. His hard work and determination to make a place in this world is truly inspirational. <br>
    His goal is to become a brand ambassador of an international company and to win the Mr India title. <br>
    His long term goal is to start a clothing brand all the while still training young models all over Tamil Nadu and potentially India. <br>
    His ambition is truly remarkable.</p>

      <p>EARLY LIFE :<br><br>
    
        Shan was born August 26, 1995 in Palakkad, Kerala. <br>
        A miracle baby born with a life threatening fever that made doctors believe he wouldn’t make it, survived. <br>
        Shan was raised by a single mother who is his biggest fan and one true hero.  <br>
        At school he was known as the hyper kid who made everyone laugh. <br>
        Shan was athletic and enjoyed anything and everything that made him feel alive. <br>
        He enjoyed dancing in his free time and looked up to Michael Jackson. <br>
        Even as a child, Shan yearned to be different and always stood out of the crowd. <br><br>
        
        During the first year of college is when Shan discovered his deep interest in the world of modelling. <br>
        Getting a start wasn’t easy, when his friends did not include him in their recreational photoshoots. <br>
        The first time he was invited to these unfriendly photoshoots he was teased for his lack of style. <br>
        This drove him to figure out his model instincts and led him to grow out his hair which later become the star of the show.<br><br>
      
        <h1>THE BIRTH OF ACARA :</h1><br><br>
    
        Shan had his fair share of struggles when it comes of succeeding in this industry. He has faced criticism, failure, harassment and been laughed at.<br>
        He knows the pain that comes when working in a field of competitors, trolls and predators and doesn’t wish it upon anyone.<br>
        He looks at budding models and hopes to help and guide them through the tough times. <br>
        This is the reason for finding the first ever modelling company in Coimbatore, “ACARA Modelling Management”.<br><br>
        
        ACARA found in the year 2019 is an active modelling-training company that provides workshops that educate aspiring models on modelling. <br>
        The workshop goers are then taken under the ACARA wing and given adequate training to transform them from amateur￼ models to modelling superstars. <br>
        Shan believes in the potential of these young models and moulds them as confident models ready to take over the world. <br>
        The only aim of this company is to train models and show them the way to success </p>
